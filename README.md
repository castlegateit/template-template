# Template template

A template for static templates. Note that `package.json` uses `*` for dependency versions, which will download the latest available versions. You may want to switch to something like `^2.1.x` to ensure you only get versions compatible with, for example, 2.1.x. See [documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#dependencies).

## Gulp tasks

*   **default**: compile CSS and JavaScript and exit.
*   **serve**: serve static template files on port 8080.
*   **watch**: compile CSS and JavaScript, recompile on file change, and serve static template files on port 8080.
